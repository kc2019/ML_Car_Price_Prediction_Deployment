Steps to deploy ML model into Web Framework using Flask:-
=======================================================

create anaconda environment
 https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

1) create new envirnment in Anaconda for this project :
   conda create -n myenv python=3.7
   e.g. conda create -n car_prediction python=3.7

2) Activate the new conda environment
   conda activate car_prediction

3) Open Jupyter Notebook and build your model
   while import the python library, if you see any issue then install the packages
   e.g. pip install sklearn

4) save your model in pickle file and download that pickle file into the same folder for this project

5) check conda avilable envirnments usuing the below :
   conda info --envs

6) Activate conda environment

7) create HTML file to get the user input and put the HTML file into "templates" sub-folder, under your project folder
   if not exists, then create it
   D:\KUNTAL\Python\Data Science Course\Live Classes on Machine Learning\PROJECT\Cardekho\templates
   e.g. car_prediction.html

8) now create a python (filename.py) file to read the user input from HTML file and call the pickle file
   to predict the selling price
   NOTE : you can open Spyder editor to edit both .py and .html file
   e.g. car_prediction.py
 
9) Install the below packages, if not done
   pip install flask
   pip install jsonify
   pip install requests

10) create requirement.txt file usuing the below
   conda list -e > requirements.txt
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

11) go to your project folder and run the python file (filename.py)
    e.g. python car_prediction.py

    (base) D:\KUNTAL\Python\Data Science Course\Live Classes on Machine Learning\PROJECT\Cardekho>python car_prediction.py
 * Serving Flask app "car_prediction" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Restarting with windowsapi reloader
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 165-083-425
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

12) open the URL in your browser, from the above output and run
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

13) user will put the value in form and click the button to get the predicted selling price of the car in the browser
